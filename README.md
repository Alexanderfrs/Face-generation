# Face generation

This repository is my solution to `Project 4` of Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). In this project, I built a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), trained on the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and generated "fake" celebrity images that look as realistic as the images in the original dataset.

## Models
* DCGAN from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)
